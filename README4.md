## What makes a computer a computer 
## How information is represented using electricity
* The computer workes as on/off technique and deal with binary number, that's for every character text or sound or whatever.

## How computer make circuits
* Computer make a merege for the input signals to make output, the merege process done by logical gates (and, or, not....etc) and signal adder for example
0 and 1 the output will be 0

## What is the 4 parts of computer 
* The input can be different part connected to computer and sending signal (mouse, keyboard....etc).
* Memory (harddisk, ram, rom, cash).
* Processor (CPU).
* Output (monitor, speaker....etc).
