# Comparison Operators

## Evaluating conditions
Is logical sign compare between variables, and the result true or fules

* Equal to " == " to see if are the same.
* Is not equal to " != " to see if they are not the same.
* Strict not equal to " !== " to check both the data type and value are not the same.
* Strict equal to " === " to check both the data type and value are the same.
* Greater than " > " check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
* less than " < " check if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
* Greater than or equal to " >= " check if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right.
* less than or equal to " <= " check if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.
* Logical and " && " tests more than one condition.
* Logical or " || " tests at least one condition.
* Logical not " !" takes a signal boolean value and inverts it.

# Loops

## For Loop
for (var i=1; i<10; i++) {g=10}

* Initialization " i=1 " Run before the first execution on the loop. This expression is commonly used to create Counters, Variables created here are scoped to the loop. Once the loop has finished it’s execution they are destroyed.

* Condition " i<10 "  Expression that is checked prior to the execution of every iteration. If omitted, this expression evaluates to true. If it evaluates to true, the loop’s statement is executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops.

* Final-expression " i++ "  Expression that is run after every iteration. Usually used to increment a counter. But it can be used to decrement a counter too.

* statement " g=10 "  Code to be repeated in the loop.

## While Loop
while (i<10) {g=10; i++}
Its word as for loop.
** Note: ** " g=10 " is just an example, and i++ the same i=i+1.
