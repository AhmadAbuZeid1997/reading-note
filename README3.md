# HTML, CSS, JavaScript Introduction
Web browsers are build using objects, window object what you can see one the window and document object the pages loaded in the browsers in the head,
for the document object we have properties, method, and events.
before dealing with JavaScript, you need to know how the browser see the web, it's in three steps are:
* receive a page as HTML code 
* create a model of the page and store it in memory
* then rendering engine
If tou use JavaScript, the interpter ( scripting engine) will transulate to browser.
THe HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fit together to make a web page, each had a job to do 
<html> content layer "important content"
[CSS] presentation layer "style"
JavaScript() behavior layer "interaction"
JavaScript formula
document.write('Good afternoon!')
Where the 'document' is the object and other things is the method
To declare variables use 
var quantity;
Where 'var' variable key word and 'quantity' variable name
to assign variable value use 
quantity = 3;
Where 3 is value 
the value called data type, we have three types numeric '0.75', string 'Hi,Ivg!', and boolean 'true'.
